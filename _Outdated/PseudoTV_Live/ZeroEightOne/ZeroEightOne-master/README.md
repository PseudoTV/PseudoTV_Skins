PseudoTV Live Skin - ZeroEightOne 081
============
*** REQUIRES PsuedoTV Live v.0.5.7 OR GREATER ***
https://github.com/Lunatixz/script.pseudotv.live

Install as you would any other PTVL skin.
Included are some all white channel logo icons in the proper size for the skin to get you started.
You can use other icon sets if you wish, but you should always consider using the correctly sized logo images to avoid slowing down your EPG.
